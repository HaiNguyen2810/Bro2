Gitcoin Passport, also known as passport Gitcoin is an application that allows users to verify their identity on web3 without having to rely on a centralized database. To authenticate, users will need to collect "stamps" from various validators on both web2 and web3 such as Google, Twitter, Lens Protocol, zkSync, etc.
